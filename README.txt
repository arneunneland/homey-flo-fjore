With the Norwegian Tidelevels (Flo og Fj√¶re) app, automate your home (or boathouse?) based on the tides, exclusively for Norwegian waters. Receive events at high and low tides, and integrate relevant triggers for your flows.

This is the initial version, and further features might be added based on interest and time. Note that flow cards might change until version 1.0.0.

To activate, add a device. By default, the app uses Homey's location, but you can input custom coordinates for local tides under the device's advanced settings. Currently, you can add only one device.
